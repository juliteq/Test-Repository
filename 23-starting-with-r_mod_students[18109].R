# The comment character in R is `#` (read "number sign"), anything to the right of a `#` in a
# script will be ignored by R. It is useful to leave notes, and
# explanations in your scripts. 

# You can get output from R simply by typing math in the console:

3 + 5
12 / 7

 
# Assign values to objects. To create an object, we need to give it a name followed by the
# assignment operator `<-`, and the value we want to give it:

weight_kg <- 55
# `<-` is the assignment operator. It assigns values on the right to
# objects on the left: 3 **goes into** `x`. 
# Objects can be given any name such as `x`, `current_temperature`, or
# `subject_id`. You want your object names to be explicit and not too
# long. They cannot start with a number (`2x` is not valid, but `x2`
# is). R is case sensitive (e.g., `weight_kg` is different from
# `Weight_kg`). There are some names that cannot be used because they
# are the names of fundamental functions in R (e.g., `if`, `else`,
# `for`. It's important to be consistent in the styling of
# your code (where you put spaces, how you name objects, etc.). Using a
# consistent coding style makes your code clearer to read for your
# future self and your collaborators.

# When assigning a value to an object, R does not print anything. You can force R to print the value by using parentheses
 
weight_kg <- 55    # doesn't print anything
(weight_kg <- 55)  # but putting parenthesis around the call prints the value of `weight_kg`
weight_kg          # and so does typing the name of the object

# 
# Now that R has `weight_kg` in memory, we can do arithmetic with it. 
2.2 * weight_kg

# 
# We can also change an object's value by assigning it a new one:
# 

weight_kg <- 57.5
2.2 * weight_kg

# 
# This means that assigning a value to one object does not change the values of
# other objects. For example, let's store the animal's weight in pounds in a new
# object, `weight_lb`:
# 

weight_lb <- 2.2 * weight_kg

# 
# and then change `weight_kg` to 100.
# 

weight_kg <- 100


# Question
# What do you think is the current content of the object weight_lb? 126.5 or 220?
weight_lb

# Question

# What are the values after each statement in the following?
# 

mass <- 47.5            # mass?
age  <- 122             # age?
mass <- mass * 2.0      # mass?
age  <- age - 20        # age?
mass_index <- mass/age  # mass_index?


# ## Functions and their arguments

# ## Functions and their arguments
# 
# Functions are "canned scripts" that automate more complicated sets of commands
# including operations assignments, etc. Many functions are predefined, or can be
# made available by importing R *packages* (more on that later). A function
# usually gets one or more inputs called *arguments*. Functions often (but not
# always) return a *value*. A typical example would be the function `sqrt()`. The
# input (the argument) must be a number, and the return value (in fact, the
# output) is the square root of that number. Executing a function ('running it')
# is called *calling* the function. An example of a function call is:
# 
a <- 9
b <- sqrt(a)

# 
# Here, the value of `a` is given to the `sqrt()` function, the `sqrt()` function
# calculates the square root, and returns the value which is then assigned to
# the object `b`. This function is very simple, because it takes just one argument.
# 
# The return 'value' of a function need not be numerical (like that of `sqrt()`),
# and it also does not need to be a single item: it can be a set of things, or
# even a dataset. We'll see that when we read data files into R.
# 
# Arguments can be anything, not only numbers or filenames, but also other
# objects. Exactly what each argument means differs per function, and must be
# looked up in the documentation. Some functions take arguments which
# may either be specified by the user, or, if left out, take on a *default* value.
# 
# Let's try a function that can take multiple arguments: `round()`.
# 

round(3.14159)

# 
# Here, we've called `round()` with just one argument, `3.14159`, and it has
# returned the value `3`.  That's because the default is to round to the nearest
# whole number. If we want more digits we can see how to do that by getting
# information about the `round` function.  We can use `args(round)`, which 
# displays the argument names and corresponding default values of a function 
# or look at the help for this function using `?round`.
# 

args(round)


?round

# 
# We see that if we want a different number of digits, we can
# type `digits=2` or however many we want.

round(3.14159, digits = 2)

# 
# If you provide the arguments in the exact same order as they are defined you
# don't have to name them:

round(3.14159, 2)

# 
# And if you do name the arguments, you can switch their order:

round(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)

 
# ## Vectors and data types
# 

# A vector is the most common and basic data type in R, and is pretty much
# the workhorse of R. A vector is composed by a series of values, which can be
# either numbers or characters. We can assign a series of values to a vector using
# the `c()` function. For example we can create a vector of animal weights and assign
# it to a new object `weight_g`:
# 

weight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
weight_g

# 
# A vector can also contain characters:
# 

molecules <- c("dna", "rna", "protein")
molecules

# 
# The quotes around "dna", "rna", etc. are essential here. Without the
# quotes R will assume there are objects called `dna`, `rna` and
# `protein`. As these objects don't exist in R's memory, there will be
# an error message.
# 
# There are many functions that allow you to inspect the content of a
# vector. `length()` tells you how many elements are in a particular vector:
# 

length(weight_g)
length(molecules)

# 
# An important feature of a vector, is that all of the elements are the
# same type of data.  The function `class()` indicates the class (the
# type of element) of an object:
# 

class(weight_g)
class(molecules)

# 
# The function `str()` provides an overview of the structure of an
# object and its elements. It is a useful function when working with
# large and complex objects:
# 

str(weight_g)
str(molecules)

# 
# You can use the `c()` function to add other elements to your vector:
# 

weight_g <- c(weight_g, 90) # add to the end of the vector

# Here, we took the original vector `weight_g`, add the
# value `90` to the end of it, and save the result back into
# `weight_g`.

weight_g <- c(30, weight_g) # add to the beginning of the vector

# Then we add the value `30` to the beginning, again saving
# the result back into `weight_g`.

weight_g

# 
# 
# A **vector** is the simplest R **data type** and is a linear vector of
# a single type. Above, we saw 2 of the 6 main **vector** types that R
# uses: `"character"` and `"numeric"` (or `"double"`). These are the
# basic building blocks that all R objects are built from. The other 4
# **vector** types are:
# 
# - `"logical"` for `TRUE` and `FALSE` (the boolean data type)
# - `"integer"` for integer numbers (e.g., `2L`, the `L` indicates to R
#   that it's an integer)
# - `"complex"` to represent complex numbers with real and imaginary
#   parts (e.g., `1 + 4i`) and that's all we're going to say about them
# - `"raw"` for bitstreams that we won't discuss further
# 
# You can check the type of your vector using the `typeof()` function
# and inputting your vector as the argument.
# typeof(weight) 
# Vectors are one of the many **data structures** that R uses. Other
# important ones are lists (`list`), matrices (`matrix`), data frames
# (`data.frame`), factors (`factor`) and arrays (`array`).
typeof(weight_g)
## Weâ€™ve seen that vectors can be mostly of type character, numeric
## and logical. But what happens if we try to mix these types in a
## single vector?

# Question
# What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use `class()` to
# check the data type of your objects):
# 

num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
class(num_char)
class(char_logical)
class(num_logical)

## You've probably noticed that objects of different types get
## converted into a single, shared type within a vector.
# 
# ## Subsetting vectors
# 
# If we want to extract one or several values from a vector, we must
# provide one or several indices in square brackets. For instance:

molecules <- c("dna", "rna", "peptide", "protein")
molecules[2]
molecules[c(3, 2)]
molecules[3,2]
# 
# We can also repeat the indices to create an object with more elements
# than the original one:

more_molecules <- molecules[c(1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4)]
more_molecules
str(more_molecules)
class(more_molecules)
# 
# Note: R indices start at 1. Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB,
# Julia, and R start counting at 1, because that's what human beings
# typically do. Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl,
# and Python) count from 0 because that's simpler for computers to do.
# 
# Finally, it is also possible to get all the elements of a vector
# except some specified elements using negative indices:
# 

molecules ## all molecules
molecules[-1] ## all but the first one
molecules[-c(1, 3)] ## all but 1st/3rd ones
molecules[c(-1, -3)] ## all but 1st/3rd ones
molecules[c(1:3)]
molecules[-c(1:3)]
# 
# Question
# 
# Here is another example of a character vector called `fruits`:

fruits <- c("apple", "orange", "grape")
fruits<-c(fruits, "melon", "pineapple")
# 
# * add the elements *melon* and *pineapple* to this vector
# * sort them in alphabetic order in both the following ways:
#     manually by using their index position,
fruits[c(1,3,4,2,5)]

#     and by using `sort()` (see `?sort`).
sort(fruits,TRUE)
sort(fruits,FALSE)
#
# ## Conditional subsetting
# 
# Another common way of sub-setting is by using a logical vector. `TRUE` will
# select the element with the same index, while `FALSE` will not:
# 

weight_g <- c(21, 34, 39, 54, 55)
weight_g[c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)]

# 
# Typically, these logical vectors are not typed by hand, but are the
# output of other functions or logical tests. For instance, if you
# wanted to select only the values above 50:
# 

## will return logicals with TRUE for the indices that meet
## the condition
weight_g > 50
## so we can use this to select only the values above 50
weight_g[weight_g > 50]

# 
# You can combine multiple tests using `&` (both conditions are true,
# AND) or `|` (at least one of the conditions is true, OR):

weight_g[weight_g <= 30 | weight_g > 50]
weight_g[weight_g >= 30 & weight_g == 90]

# 
# Here, `<` stands for "less than", `>` for "greater than", `>=` for
# "greater than or equal to", and `==` for "equal to". The double equal
# sign `==` is a test for numerical equality between the left and right
# hand sides, and should not be confused with the single `=` sign, which
# performs variable assignment (similar to `<-`).
# 
# A common task is to search for certain strings in a vector.  One could
# use the "or" operator `|` to test for equality to multiple values, but
# this can quickly become tedious. The function `%in%` allows you to
# test if any of the elements of a search vector are found:
# 

molecules <- c("dna", "rna", "protein", "peptide")
molecules[molecules == "rna" | molecules == "dna"] # returns both rna and dna
molecules %in% c("rna", "dna", "metabolite", "peptide", "glycerol")
molecules[molecules %in% c("rna", "dna", "metabolite", "peptide", "glycerol")]

# 
# Question
# Based on the `height` vector below, select heights that are above 190 or below or equal to 170

height <- c(163, 189, 210, 177, 168, 192, 170)
height[height > 50]
height[height > 190 | height<=170]

# 
# 
# Question
# Based on the `fruits` vector below:
# 
# *  to only have melon and apple
# * test that orange is included in this vector and mango is not
# 

fruits <- c("apple", "orange", "grape", "melon", "pineapple",
            "banana", "grape", "orange", "melon")
fruits[c(1,4)]
fruits


# 
# 
# Question
# Can you figure out why `"four" > "five"` returns `TRUE`?

"four">"five"

# 
# ## Names
# 
# It is possible to name each element of a vector. The code chunk below
# show a initial vector without any names, how names are set, and
# retrieved.
# 

x <- c(1, 5, 3, 5, 10)
names(x) ## no names
names(x) <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E")
names(x) ## now we have names
x
# 
# When a vector has names, it is possible to access elements by their
# name, in addition to their index.
# 

x[c(1, 3)]
x[c("A", "C")]

# 
# ## Missing data
# 
# As R was designed to analyze datasets, it includes the concept of
# missing data (which is uncommon in other programming
# languages). Missing data are represented in vectors as `NA`.
# 
# When doing operations on numbers, most functions will return `NA` if
# the data you are working with include missing values. This feature
# makes it harder to overlook the cases where you are dealing with
# missing data.  You can add the argument `na.rm = TRUE` to calculate
# the result while ignoring the missing values.
# 

heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights)
max(heights)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
max(heights, na.rm = TRUE)
median(heights, na.rm = TRUE)

# 
# If your data include missing values, you may want to become familiar
# with the functions `is.na()`, `na.omit()`, and `complete.cases()`. See
# below for examples.
# 
# 

## Extract those elements which are not missing values.
heights[!is.na(heights)]

## Returns the object with incomplete cases removed.  The returned
## object is a vector of type `"numeric"` (or `"double"`).
na.omit(heights)

## Extract those elements which are complete cases.  The returned
## object is a vector of type `"numeric"` (or `"double"`).
heights[complete.cases(heights)]

# 
# 
# Question
# 
# 1. Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector with the NAs removed.

heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63,
             63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)
median(heights,na.rm =TRUE)

# 2. Use the function `median()` to calculate the median of the `heights` vector.
# 3. Use R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.
heights[heights>67]





# 
# ### Constructors {-}
# 
# There exists some functions to generate vectors of different type. To
# generate a vector of numerics, one can use the `numeric()`
# constructor, providing the length of the output vector as
# parameter. The values will be initialized with 0.
# 

numeric(3)
numeric(10)

# 
# Note that if we ask for a vector of numerics of length 0, we obtain
# exactly that:
# 

numeric(0)

# 
# There are similar constructors for characters and logicals, named
# `character()` and `logical()` respectively.
# 
# Question
# What are the defaults for character and logical vectors?


character(2) 
logical(2)   


# ### Replicate elements {-}
# 
# The `rep` function allow to repeat a value a certain number of
# times. If we want to initiate a vector of numerics of length 5 with
# the value -1, for example, we could do the following:
# 

rep(-1, 5)

# 
# Similarly, to generate a vector populated with missing values, which
# is often a good way to start, without setting assumptions on the data
# to be collected:
# 

rep(NA, 5)

# 
# `rep` can take vectors of any length as input (above, we used vectors
# of length 1) and any type. For example, if we want to repeat the
# values 1, 2 and 3 five times, we would do the following:
# 

rep(c(1, 2, 3), 5)

# 
# Question
# What if we wanted to repeat the values 1, 2 and 3 five times, but
# obtain five 1s, five 2s and five 3s in that order? There are two
# possibilities - see `?rep` or `?sort` for help.
q<-c(1,2,3,4,5)
q
r=rep(q,5)
r
sort(r,TRUE)
sort(r,FALSE)
# ### Sequence generation {-}
# 
# Another very useful function is `seq`, to generate a sequence of
# numbers. For example, to generate a sequence of integers from 1 to 20
# by steps of 2, one would use:
# 

seq(from = 1, to = 20, by = 2)
seq(1:20)
seq(1,20,2)
# 
# The default value of `by` is 1 and, given that the generate of a
# sequence of one value to another with steps of 1 is frequently used,
# there's a shortcut:
# 

seq(1, 5, 1)
seq(1, 5) ## default by
1:5

# 
# To generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 20 of final length of 3,
# one would use:
# 

seq(from = 1, to = 20, length.out = 3)

# 
# ### Random samples and permutations {-}
# 
# A last group of useful functions are those that generate random
# data. The first one, `sample`, generates a random permutation of
# another vector. For example, to draw a random order to 10 students
# oral example, I first assign each student a number from 1 to then (for
# instance based on the alphabetic order of their name) and then:
# 

sample(1:10)

# 
# Without further arguments, `sample` will return a permutation of all
# elements of the vector. If I want a random sample of a certain size, I
# would set this value as second argument. Below, I sample 5 random
# letters from the alphabet contained in the pre-defined `letters` vector:
# 

letters

sample(letters, 5)

# 
# If I wanted an output larger than the input vector, or being able to
# draw some elements multiple times, I would need to set the `replace`
# argument to `TRUE`:
# 

sample(1:5, 10, replace = TRUE)

# 
# Question
# 
# When trying the functions above out, you will have realized that the
# samples are indeed random and that one doesn't get the same
# permutation twice. To be able to reproduce these random draws, one can
# set the random number generation seed manually with `set.seed()`
# before drawing the random sample.
# 
# - Test this feature with your neighbour. First draw two random
#   permutations of `1:10` independently and observe that you get
#   different results.
# 
# - Now set the seed with, for example, `set.seed(123)` and repeat the
#   random draw. Observe that you now get the same random draws.
# 
# - Repeat by setting a different seed.
# 

# 
# ### Drawing samples from a normal distribution {-}
# 
# The last function we are going to see is `rnorm`, that draws a random
# sample from a normal distribution. Two normal distributions of means 0
# and 100 and standard deviations 1 and 5, noted noted *N(0, 1)* and
# *N(100, 5)*, are shown below
# 
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(density(rnorm(1000)), main = "", sub = "N(0, 1)")
plot(density(rnorm(1000, 100, 5)), main = "", sub = "N(100, 5)")

# 
# The three arguments, `n`, `mean` and `sd`, define the size of the
# sample, and the parameters of the normal distribution, i.e the mean
# and its standard deviation. The defaults of the latter are 0 and 1.
# 
# 

rnorm(5)
rnorm(5, 2, 2)
rnorm(5, 100, 5)

# 
# Now that we have learned how to write scripts, and the basics of R's
# data structures, we will start working with larger data, and
# learn about data frames.
# 
# ## Additional exercises
# 

# 
# Question
